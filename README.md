# Go Port Scanner

```
The result will be similar to that:

Result of function ScanPort (scan specific port):
Port result: {tcp/1024 Closed}

Result of function InitialScan (scan all ports from 1 to 1024):
[{tcp/1 Closed} {udp/1 Open} {tcp/2 Closed} {udp/2 Open} {tcp/3 Closed} {udp/3 Open}  ... {tcp/1024 Closed} {udp/1024 Open}]
```
